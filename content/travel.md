We're getting married at [Pollokshields Burgh Hall](http://www.pollokshieldsburghhall.com), just south of central Glasgow.

Glasgow is easy to get to via road, rail or air:

Driving from England, it's probably simplest to get on the M6 and keep going north.

The major train stations in Glasgow are Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street. Within the city are a number of smaller stations, and the nearest to Pollokshields Burgh Hall is Maxwell Park.

The nearest airport is [Glasgow International Airport](https://www.glasgowairport.com), which is served by EasyJet and Ryanair etc. There's a shuttle bus from the airport to the centre of Glasgow.

Alternative airpots are [Glasgow Prestwick](https://www.glasgowprestwick.com) and [Edinburgh](https://www.edinburghairport.com).
