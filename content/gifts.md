There is, of course, absolutely no need to give us a wedding gift. However, for those who have told us they would like to do so anyway, we have made a gift registry with John Lewis.

The registry can be found [here](https://www.johnlewisgiftlist.com/giftint/JSPs/GiftList/BuyGifts/GuestFindAList.jsp) (number 757647).
